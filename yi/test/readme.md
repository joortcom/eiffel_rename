The Problem:

Suppose a person who has dual US and UK residence, travels to Paris; he feels ill, and needs to withdraw some money from the bank to see a doctor:

1) the person can only have 1 (one) name
2) the person has 3 addresses: one in US, one in UK, and a temp hotel address in Paris
3) the person's bank account can only be read by the bank
4) the person's health info can only be read by doctor

Can you model this senario in your favorite programming language, and with the compiler ensuring all these constraints?
